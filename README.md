- 👋 Hi, my name is Quentin McTeer and I am currently a second year masters of economic analytics student at Georgia State University. 
I am also a public finance fellow with the Center for State and Local Finance in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State. Additionally, I am currently working as data science fellow with Bluebonnet data. Recently, I completed a summer position on the analytics team within the Credit & Risk Management department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. 

- 👀 I’m interested in econometrics, causal inference, classification issues in machine learning, financial data, polling/elections data,
and all things forecasting/prediction. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about logistic regression, random forest classification procedure, tree ensemble methods, the instrumental variable approach to causal
inference, SQL, and data visualization techniques in R. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Kaggle competitions focused on classification issues using machine learning techniques in R.
