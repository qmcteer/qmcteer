- 👋 Hi, my name is Quentin McTeer and I am currently a first year masters of economic analytics student at Georgia State University. 
I am also a public finance fellow with the Center for State and Local Finance in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State. 

- 👀 I’m interested in econometrics, causal inference, classification issues in machine learning, crowdfunding/other financing alternatives, 
and all things forecasting/prediction. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about logistic regression, random forest classification procedure, tree ensemble methods, the instrumental variable approach to causal
inference, inverse probability weighting, and data visualization techniques in R. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Kaggle competitions focused on classification issues using econometric and machine learning techniques in R.
